                  ><span class="font-bold text-2xl">The</span>  scope of Var is of two types one is global scope and the other is local scope. Usually, the var keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript which is treated as a normal variable. If we put Var inside the function it will still work and if it is placed outside the function it will still work. <br />

                  <span class="font-bold text-2xl mt-3">let</span> is a block scope. It only works inside functions. Meaning if we put the let inside the function it will work. And if placed outside then it will not work.
                  <br />
                  <span class="font-bold text-2xl mt-3">const</span> is a block scope. It only works inside functions. Meaning if we put const inside the function it will work. And if placed outside then it will not work. It only intercepts inside the function. Not anywhere else.

                  ><span class="font-bold">Null</span> represents the
                  intentional absence of any object or value. It is often used
                  to signify that a variable or property does not have a
                  meaningful value at a certain point in the code. For example,
                  you might set a variable to null when you want to clear its
                  value. <br />
                  <span class="font-bold">Undefined</span> is used to indicate
                  that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned
                  any value yet. It is the default value of uninitialized
                  variables. When you create a variable without assigning a
                  value to it, it is automatically set to undefined.</span

                  Representational State Transfer Application Programming
                  Interface, is a web service architecture that simplifies
                  communication between software systems on the internet. It
                  uses unique URLs to represent resources and employs standard
                  HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for various
                  operations. REST is stateless, meaning each request must carry
                  all necessary information. It allows multiple data
                  representations and enforces a consistent interface. By
                  adhering to a client-server model, REST APIs have become a
                  widely adopted and efficient means of enabling interaction
                  between diverse software components over the web.</span
