                  ><span class="font-bold text-2xl">The</span>  scope of Var is of two types one is global scope and the other is local scope. Usually, the var keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript which is treated as a normal variable. If we put Var inside the function it will still work and if it is placed outside the function it will still work. <br />

                  <span class="font-bold text-2xl mt-3">let</span> is a block scope. It only works inside functions. Meaning if we put the let inside the function it will work. And if placed outside then it will not work.
                  <br />
                  <span class="font-bold text-2xl mt-3">const</span> is a block scope. It only works inside functions. Meaning if we put const inside the function it will work. And if placed outside then it will not work. It only intercepts inside the function. Not anywhere else.
